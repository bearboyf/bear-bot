# bear-bot
Bearbot is a discord bot created by the part-time amateur coder Jamie the Bear. The bot itself offers basic functions such as a "say" command in which the bot will repeat the user's input, but with "!!!!" at the end. 
Bearbot is in continuous development, and whilst his code may be considered basic, it is perpetually being improved and added to, with new functions as often as possible!
